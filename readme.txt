**Bad Bots: A Growing Danger**

>Can you imagine the sheer volume of data crossing the internet every second? It's truly monstrous, isn't it? Millions of interactions, searches, and transactions...
>Well, brace yourself for a staggering statistic: according to Cloudflare, the online security giant, about **one-third (approximately 30-33%) of all this global traffic is generated by bots** – that is, by computer programs, not humans.
>And even more alarming: from this immense volume of bot traffic, Cloudflare identified that **8.6% have malicious purposes** (Q1 2024 data). This means that approximately 2.5% of ALL internet traffic consists of malicious bots constantly active, searching for loopholes, **stealing data**, or trying to take down sites!  **That’s nearly 2 million attacks every second sweeping across the web.** 
>But the news doesn't stop there: this **malicious bot activity is constantly evolving and increasing.** A key reason for this alarming trend is that: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is empowering even less-skilled attackers to create bots to steal information, while ready-made attack kits are sold on the dark web, amplifying both the volume and sophistication of threats.
>Furthermore, the emergence of many **new Artificial Intelligence websites** means they now deploy their own bots for web crawling and data gathering, contributing significantly to overall bot traffic.


>Bots can have a **negative impact on your website in a number of ways**. They can **overload your server**, which can cause performance problems such as **slowness and longer response times**. They can also look for vulnerabilities in your website and **steal your content**, which can **damage your SEO**.

>**Amplify Your Server's Defenses!** Optional. When StopBadBots blocks a threat, it **automatically sets up Fail2Ban** to intercept and block that IP on all **future attempts before they even reach your WordPress site**. So, if you manage your own VPS, Cloud, or Dedicated server with Fail2Ban installed, **this is a game-changer!**
> **Optional Fail2ban Monitor with GUI**: The SBB Fail2Ban Monitor brings your server's powerful Fail2Ban protection into a clear, visual WordPress dashboard – the user-friendly **GUI many have been waiting for!**
>Currently, you can track key Fail2ban details like the offending IP, when the last attempt occurred, the specific Security Rule (jail) triggered, the number of attempts, and how long the ban lasts. This is your first step towards richer insights like daily totals, activity graphs, and more detailed ban reasons.

>Stop Bad Bots, SPAM bots, Crawlers and spiders without DNS Cloud or API (EndPoint) Traffic Redirection and without slow down your site. **No google penalties**. Multilanguage ready. Included also Dutch, French, Germany, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese language files.
